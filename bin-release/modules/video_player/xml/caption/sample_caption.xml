				<p begin="00:00:02">Building on a decade of innovation.</p>
				<p begin="00:00:05">One company remains uniquely capable of <span style="emph">powering the Internet</span>,</p>
				<p begin="00:00:08">having forever changed the World Wide Web.</p>
				<p begin="00:00:21">Founded commercially just ten years ago,</p>
				<p begin="00:00:23">Akamai&#39;s origins date back to the mid 1990&#39;s inside the halls of MIT.</p>
				<p begin="00:00:29">An academic project looking for ways to reduce Internet traffic congestion</p>
				<p begin="00:00:34">set in motion a Web revolution.</p>
				<p begin="00:00:36">Professor Tom Leighton and graduate student Danny Lewin,</p>
				<p begin="00:00:39">working with fellow mathematicians and computer scientists,</p>
				<p begin="00:00:42">came up with a way to solve the Internet&#39;s <span style="emph">hot spot</span> problem.</p>
				<p begin="00:00:46">This was the challenge.</p>
				<p begin="00:00:48">Just as something on the Net became popular,</p>
				<p begin="00:00:50">few could access it because Web sites became overloaded.</p>
				<p begin="00:00:54">Akamai would solve this problem.</p>
				<p begin="00:00:56">The founding team explored radical, new approaches to changing</p>
				<p begin="00:01:00">the way Internet content was delivered</p>
				<p begin="00:01:03">to a rapidly growing community of  online users around the globe.</p>
				<p begin="00:01:07">How could they get all users connected to the Web sites they wanted</p>
				<p begin="00:01:11">regardless of demand levels or Internet traffic conditions?</p>
				<p begin="00:01:15">The group poured over models of Internet connections and traffic behavior</p>
				<p begin="00:01:18">searching for a better answer.</p>
				<p begin="00:01:20">What emerged from Leighton, Lewin, and their colleagues</p>
				<p begin="00:01:23">was a blueprint for a new way to deliver what everyone wanted:</p>
				<p begin="00:01:26">guaranteed quality of service for Web sites</p>
				<p begin="00:01:29" end="00:01:33">and for anyone who wanted to access them.</p>
				<p begin="00:01:34">Many online events in the early days of the Internet</p>
				<p begin="00:01:38">were perfectly suited for Akamai&#39;s ground-breaking technology.</p>
				<p begin="00:01:41">Online fashion shows, rock concerts, and movie trailers</p>
				<p begin="00:01:45">attracted large numbers of users.</p>
				<p begin="00:01:48">But all too often the sites weren&#39;t usable because of poor Internet performance.</p>
				<p begin="00:01:52">Akamai transformed the Web from something often slow and unreliable</p>
				<p begin="00:01:55">into a high performance, real-time place for entertainment, information and commerce.</p>
				<p begin="00:02:01">Effectively creating an express lane on the Internet</p>
				<p begin="00:02:05">to the Web&#39;s most popular sites.</p>
				<p begin="00:02:07">This is what company CEO George Conrades and then president</p>
				<p begin="00:02:11">and now current Chief Executive Paul Sagan called Akamai&#39;s &quot;big idea&quot;.</p>
				<p begin="00:02:15">An idea that changed the Internet forever.</p>
				<p begin="00:02:20">Launching its first commercial service, <span style="emph">FreeFlow</span> in the Spring of &#39;99</p>
				<p begin="00:02:24">Akamai caught the attention of the Web&#39;s publishing pioneers.</p>
				<p begin="00:02:28">As other content providers took notice, Akamai grew rapidly.</p>
				<p begin="00:02:32">In the Fall of &#39;99 an ambitious project mobilized a global community</p>
				<p begin="00:02:37">and the Akamai team streamed three live NetAid rock concerts</p>
				<p begin="00:02:41">over the internet to drive awareness about global poverty.</p>
				<p begin="00:02:45">In just days later, start-up Akamai posted one of the most</p>
				<p begin="00:02:49">successful initial public offerings in the history of the NASDAQ stock exchange.</p>
				<p begin="00:02:53">Akamai&#39;s value grew quickly across many industries.</p>
				<p begin="00:02:57">Helping customers flawlessly present major Web events</p>
				<p begin="00:03:01">such as March Madness,  news coverage of the U.S. presidential elections,</p>
				<p begin="00:03:05">and the downloading of critical software updates</p>
				<p begin="00:03:08">to counter-act attacks from malware with names like</p>
				<p begin="00:03:11">&quot;The I love you&quot; virus and &quot;Slammer&quot;.</p>
				<p begin="00:03:14">Even in the company&#39;s darkest hour,</p>
				<p begin="00:03:17">Akamai&#39;s services worked flawlessly, providing invaluable assistance</p>
				<p begin="00:03:20">to government, transportation, news and other information providers</p>
				<p begin="00:03:23">to keep their Web sites up and running in the face of unprecedented user demand.</p>
				<p begin="00:03:28">As the Web evolved, streaming audio and video took off.</p>
				<p begin="00:03:31">Creating a potential for a whole new way to entertain and inform.</p>
				<p begin="00:03:35">But all too often the user experience wasn&#39;t a good one,</p>
				<p begin="00:03:38">marred by jittery thumbnail videos.</p>
				<p begin="00:03:41">Again, Akamai would change all that.</p>
				<p begin="00:03:44">Being called on to Webcast the Oscars,</p>
				<p begin="00:03:46" style="quote">&quot;A Massachusetts company called Akamai is providing the technology to</p>
				<p begin="00:03:49" style="quote">catch some of the action on the Internet.&quot;</p>
				<p begin="00:03:52">Professional sporting events,</p>
				<p begin="00:03:54">and even global competitions,</p>
				<p begin="00:03:57">from the World Cup,</p>
				<p begin="00:03:59">to the Olympics.</p>
				<p begin="00:04:03">The Internet also forever changed the music industry</p>
				<p begin="00:04:06">and Akamai was there again to download billions of songs</p>
				<p begin="00:04:09">for Apple&#39;s revolutionary iTunes service.</p>
				<p begin="00:04:13">The Internet didn&#39;t stop there.</p>
				<p begin="00:04:15">Hurricane traffic,</p>
				<p begin="00:04:17">Shuttle launches,</p>
				<p begin="00:04:20">the largest software downloads,</p>
				<p begin="00:04:22">the Internet changed how we worked,</p>
				<p begin="00:04:24">lived,</p>
				<p begin="00:04:26">and played.</p>
				<p begin="00:04:28">And one company, Akamai, made this revolution possible.</p>
				<p begin="00:04:33">Having pioneered Internet content delivery,</p>
				<p begin="00:04:36">Akamai&#39;s approach remains unique to this day,</p>
				<p begin="00:04:39">an approach that embodies the Akamai difference.</p>
				<p begin="00:04:42">At the heart of the Akamai difference is an unswerving commitment</p>
				<p begin="00:04:45">to advanced technology, research and development.</p>
				<p begin="00:04:49">In staying manically focused on the customer,</p>
				<p begin="00:04:53">while remaining true to the founders vision of building out a massively</p>
				<p begin="00:04:57">distributed computing platform to support hundreds of terabits per second</p>
				<p begin="00:05:00">of Web content and mission critical applications.</p>
				<p begin="00:05:04">The Akamai difference is about global performance, scale, control, insight,</p>
				<p begin="00:05:08">and reliability.</p>
				<p begin="00:05:10" end="00:05:15">It is about giving customers the power of the Internet.</p>
				<p begin="00:05:17" style="quote">&quot;One of the most important benefits of partnering with Akamai</p>
				<p begin="00:05:20" style="quote">is that we now have on-demand scalability.</p>
				<p begin="00:05:23" style="quote">Especially as we expand into global markets.</p>
				<p begin="00:05:26" style="quote">MySpace has off-loaded 98% of international traffic from origin servers</p>
				<p begin="00:05:29" end="00:05:35" style="quote">onto the Akamai platform, avoiding the need to deploy servers World-wide.&quot;</p>
				<p begin="00:05:36" style="quote">&quot;The Akamai Web Application Accelerator solution has blown away all expectations.</p>
				<p begin="00:05:41" style="quote">We&#39;ve increased portal adoption and we can insure that all global users</p>
				<p begin="00:05:45" end="00:05:48" style="quote">have a consistent experience.&quot;</p>
				<p begin="00:05:49" style="quote">&quot;It was very important to us to make sure that the fans in Taiwan</p>
				<p begin="00:05:52" style="quote">had the same experience as the fans in New York.</p>
				<p begin="00:05:55" style="quote">So Akamai was the company we went to</p>
				<p begin="00:05:58" style="quote">because Akamai provides real intelligence at the edge</p>
				<p begin="00:06:02" end="00:06:07" style="quote">to make our scores work in a timely manner across the globe.&quot;</p>
				<p begin="00:06:09" style="quote">&quot;Audi has a centralized Web infrastructure</p>
				<p begin="00:06:11" style="quote">and an international presence.</p>
				<p begin="00:06:13" style="quote">This would not be possible without Akamai.</p>
				<p begin="00:06:15" style="quote">We can now easily expand our Web presence internationally</p>
				<p begin="00:06:18" style="quote">while continuing to build the global Audi brand.</p>
				<p begin="00:06:21" end="00:06:25" style="quote">Akamai takes a lot of our worries away.&quot;</p>
				<p begin="00:06:26" style="quote">Akamai provides the gold standard in content delivery,</p>
				<p begin="00:06:30">so the choice was simple.&quot;</p>
				<p begin="00:06:33">Consumers of everything digital are rushing to the Web</p>
				<p begin="00:06:36">to access a nearly unlimited selection of music,</p>
				<p begin="00:06:39">movies, games, sports, news, and commerce.</p>
				<p begin="00:06:44">And as businesses move more and more of their key processes online</p>
				<p begin="00:06:49">Akamai has emerged as one of the most important companies</p>
				<p begin="00:06:52">enabling the Internet to meet the daily crush of requests</p>
				<p begin="00:06:55">for rich, dynamic and interactive content,</p>
				<p begin="00:06:58">transactions and applications.</p>
				<p begin="00:07:00">In a decade Akamai transformed the Internet from a chaotic place</p>
				<p begin="00:07:04">with unpredictable performance and scale, into a secure and reliable place</p>
				<p begin="00:07:08">for users and content providers to meet and do business.</p>
				<p begin="00:07:12">In just ten years we&#39;ve seen the Web transform from text-based simple sites</p>
				<p begin="00:07:17">into full color and then full motion experiences.</p>
				<p begin="00:07:20">Advertising models customized and targeted to maximize returns,</p>
				<p begin="00:07:24">social networking revolutionizing human interaction,</p>
				<p begin="00:07:28">online programming that now competes with television,</p>
				<p begin="00:07:31">and businesses executing on global ambitions.</p>
				<p begin="00:07:35">And they all do it together, reliably with Akamai.</p>
				<p begin="00:07:39" end="00:07:43">Akamai, powering the online world.</p>
